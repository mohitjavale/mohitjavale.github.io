							<h1 class="major">Fascinating Favourites</h1>
							
							<p>I feel the favourites of a person are one of the defining trait of that unique person. </br>
                            Afterall, from a prespective, we all are RL agents in a common environment, having similar achitectures in our brains. What is different is our upbringing/'training', which can get reflected in one's tendencies or favourties, which I see as just stimulus, which in-turn activate regions more frequently and are associated with curiosity. Further, usually thinking about favourites is a pretty thougt invoking process imo, making us thinking of all other possible alternatives, qualities which differ among the alternatives on a abstract level, and often justifying a particular favourite over another lead us into very innvative and wierd thought trains.
                            <p>However, I have noticed that as we grow , we tend to ignore such thoughts considering them 'childish' in nature, and pay them less heed, even forgetting them at times. In an attempt to avoid the same happening to me, I would like to maintatin this list for a future me to read into and remember, as well as provide others a chance to try to paint a picture about my nature, without even interacting me. </p>
